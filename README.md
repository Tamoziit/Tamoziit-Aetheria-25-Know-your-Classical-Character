**Aetheria** is the annual inter-college fashion and design extravaganza organized by the **Heritage Fashion Club** (HFC) of Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata. Conceived as a celebration of fashion in its purest and most expressive form, Aetheria offers a vibrant platform for emerging models and designers to showcase their creativity, confidence, and individuality.

More than just a competition, *Aetheria embodies the confluence of art, culture, and innovation—where style meets vision, and imagination takes the spotlight*. It stands as a tribute to the boundless spirit of youth and the transformative power of fashion as an art form.

## Fashion Through Classical Literature
*Where words once painted emotions, fashion now weaves their echoes. Fashion Through Classical Literature is a celebration of storytelling reborn in fabric and form—a tribute to the timeless charm of the world’s greatest classics*.

Drawing inspiration from both Eastern and Western Classics, each creation shall evoke the spirit of bygone worlds—rich with culture, philosophy, and imagination—uniting the poetic serenity of the East with the dramatic eloquence of the West. Each creation reimagines the essence of classic tales—woven with nostalgia, emotions, and timeless artistry.

Through texture, color, and expression, we aim at reviving the mystical soul and literary magic of these immortal works, transporting the audience to eras where imagination ruled and beauty was written between the lines.
